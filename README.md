- 👀 I enjoy front end development the most, to be able to see in real time what is happening to your components/elements
- 🌱 I’m currently a Java Full Stack developer working on building my portfolio as I learn and grow
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything to get my feet wet, I'm eager to learn and what better way than to work with others.
