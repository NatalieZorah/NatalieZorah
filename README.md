- 👋 Hi, I’m @NatalieZorah
- 👀 I've found myself enjoying C# and it's many intricacies more and more as time goes on.
- 🌱 I’m currently a self-taught C# developer working on a Discord bot, and building my portfolio as I learn and grow
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything to get my feet wet, I'm eager to learn and what better way than to work with others?
